"""
This script filters a large log file by removing lines based on two criteria:
  1. Removal regex patterns (specified in the config)
  2. Timestamp filtering â€“ only lines whose timestamp (extracted via a regex)
     fall within the configured FROM_TIMESTAMP and TO_TIMESTAMP range are kept.
     
For lines that cannot be parsed for a timestamp, the script buffers them and waits
until it finds a line with a valid timestamp. Then:
  - If that valid timestamp is older than FROM_TIMESTAMP, the entire buffered block is discarded.
  - If it is within range, the buffered block is flushed (i.e. output) and subsequent lines are processed.
  - If a valid timestamp is later than TO_TIMESTAMP, processing stops.
     
The output file is written in the same order as the input and no two consecutive empty lines are written.
Static parameters (such as chunk size, output folder, and timestamp bounds) are stored in the embedded configuration section.
     
Usage: file_log.py <log_file>
The filtered output is written to <log_file>.filtered.log in the folder specified by "output_folder" in the config.
