Quick question—do you happen to know who our main contact or consultant is from Elastic?

The reason I ask is that I’m still officially listed as an Elastic partner for professional services, even though I haven’t actually worked on any projects with their professional team yet. Just wanted to understand if that status has any impact on their side or anything related to our engagement with them.
