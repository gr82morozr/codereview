Given the recent relevance tuning cycles in Elasticsearch, I think we’re getting pretty good results. I suggest we pause further tuning in BPA for now, since the BPA data doesn’t really reflect real-world data—any more tweaks here could lead to overtuning and might not work well in production.

Let’s just note any relevance issues we find in BPA and, if needed, retest and do more tuning in a higher environment with more realistic data. This way, we make sure our changes are more general and actually perform better in prod.

Let me know if you have any questions.
